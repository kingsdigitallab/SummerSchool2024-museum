# RSE 2024 Summer school Day 2: KDL

## [Museum Virtual Tour](museum/example1)

This is a quick A-Frame example, creating a virtual tour for our museum activity and showing off a few of the features
of A-Frame.  We've made it with Glitch's 11ty template.

### Some things to keep in mind:

### Getting started

- First, remix this Glitch to make one of your own.
- You can edit this directly in browser, or clone the git repo of your new glitch, and run it locally with 11ty and node
